# Many word puzzles can be solved by iterating through a list of words while checking for characteristics specified by the puzzle.
# A list of words word_list.txt is provided in Brightspace. The file has one word per line.
#
# A blueprint file is also provided in the file puzzles.py.
# Your overall goal is to implement the functions in this file and achieve the same output as below.
# You MUST NOT change the code in the main scope or the functionsâ€™ headers.
